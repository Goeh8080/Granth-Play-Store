# Feature parity: ashok8090/Granth-Play-Store → Flutter

**Source audited:** upstream `main` of ashok8090/Granth-Play-Store (221 files):
- the shipped web bundle `mobile/android/app/src/main/assets/web/index.html`;
- its TypeScript sources in `src/` (`components/granth/*`, `lib/granth/*`, `styles.css`, `routes/*`);
- the Expo / React Native shell `mobile/App.tsx` and `app.json`;
- the native Kotlin `MainActivity` / `DownloadsModule` / `GranthBack`;
- `AndroidManifest.xml`, the `public/open` share page and `assetlinks.json`.

**Tools:** REA `analyze_javascript_application` on the extracted bundle, then a line-by-line read of the sources. Round 4 (2026-10-21): REA `open_binary` + `analyze_javascript_application` on the shipped bundle again (the whole 730 KB bundle exceeds REA's analyzer heap, so the app component `cg()` was extracted and analyzed on its own) to confirm the sync wiring (`setInterval(…, 18e4)` = every 3 min + on `online`, `granth-resume` / `visibilitychange` → `sync().then(savePages)`) and the strip counter text; REA `identify_flutter_build` on the built APK.

**Rule followed:** same UI and behaviour; animations are smoother. Where the original had a bug, the correct behaviour was built instead (see the last section).

**Legend:** ✅ done (same behaviour) · ➕ done and improved · ⏭ not ported (with the reason).

## App shell / platform

| Feature (original) | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Package `com.wnm.granthprabandhan`, label ग्रंथ प्रबंधन, portrait, light | ✅ | Same id. Different signing key, so it cannot update the Play Store install. Version for external testing: **1.0.0 (versionCode 1)** from `pubspec.yaml`; split APKs keep versionCode 1 (`force-version-code-ignoring-abi=true` in `android/gradle.properties`). The सेटिंग screen reads the version from the installed app. |
| Splash (white + mark) | ➕ | Native white launch + animated Flutter splash. It never waits more than 3.5 s for the network. |
| Hardware back (`__granthBack`): close overlay → menu → previous screen → double-back on Dashboard → exit confirm | ✅ | Same order, same 80–900 ms double-tap window, same "क्या आप बाहर निकलना चाहते हैं?" card. |
| Exit (`exit-app` → `finishAffinity`) | ✅ | MethodChannel `exitApp`. |
| Resume (`granth-resume`, reload if the WebView went blank) | ➕ | No WebView, so there is no blank state to reload. Resume syncs silently when the app was away ≥ 30 s or the data is > 2 min old. |
| Deep links `granth://open?topic|granth|id=…` and `https://granth.grok.me/open?...` | ➕ | Cold start (`getInitialLink`) and warm start (`onNewIntent` + `setIntent`). Not-found shows a message with a Dashboard button. Tested. |
| `public/open` web page / `assetlinks.json` | ⏭ | Server-side files; nothing to port into the app. |
| Startup permission prompt (notifications, media) | ⏭ (on purpose) | The original asks for notifications at start but never posts any. Here the notification state is checked the first time a PDF starts: on Android 13+ the real runtime dialog (`requestPermissions(POST_NOTIFICATIONS)` from the Activity, answer awaited); if notifications are still off — refused, or switched off by the phone (Vivo-style phones ship sideloaded apps with notifications off, also on Android ≤ 12 where there is no dialog) — a one-time themed card "PDF की सूचना बंद है" with **सेटिंग खोलें** (app notification settings). PDFs work the same either way. Storage permission is asked only when saving on Android ≤ 9; MediaStore needs none on Android 10+. |
| Whole-app pinch zoom (WebView viewport `maximum-scale=5, user-scalable=yes`, `touch-action: manipulation`) | ✅ | `AppZoom` wraps every screen: two-finger pinch 1–5× at the fingers, the layout never reflows (it is a transform), taps land on the right spot, one-finger sideways drag pans while zoomed, vertical drags still scroll lists, snaps back to 1× near 1. No double-tap zoom, same as the original (`touch-action: manipulation`). The picture viewer's own zoom wins inside the viewer. |
| Status bar maroon, safe-area padding | ✅ | |

## Data, sync, storage

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getTopics` / `getGranths` / `getPramans` from granth.wnmsolutions.com | ✅ | Same API and `text/html` JSON handling. 20 s overall timeout (the bridge used 50 s), so a dead network never keeps the spinner up. |
| Boot: show the saved copy instantly, then sync, then save pages | ✅ | `CatalogStore.boot` mirrors the zustand `cn.boot`. |
| Sync every 3 min, on reconnect, on resume, सिंक button | ➕ | Every **2 minutes** while the app is on screen (requested; the original: 3 min), plus on open, on resume and on reconnect. Background syncs are quiet: the strip does not switch to "सिंक हो रहा है", a failed fetch changes nothing on screen, two syncs never overlap, the timer does nothing in the background or offline, and only new or still-missing pages download (pages that just failed wait 15 min unless सिंक is pressed). An identical download changes nothing (no rebuild or re-index). JSON is decoded off the UI thread. |
| सिंक button (`sync().then(savePages)`, spinning icon, live strip text) | ✅ ➕ | Tap re-fetches all three lists, spins, then checks every saved page on disk (exists, real size, valid JPEG/PNG/GIF/WEBP header, JPEG end marker) and quietly re-downloads missing or damaged ones. It always shows progress, even when everything is already saved (counts up to 985/985, then done). A collapsible sync card (chevron) shows "985 में से 985 पेज सेव", a bar and "आख़िरी सिंक". No missing/failed counts are shown. The silent check also runs at app start. Cached data still shows instantly. |
| Status texts (सिंक हो रहा है, इंटरनेट नहीं · सेव किया डेटा चल रहा है, नया डेटा नहीं मिला…) | ✅ | |
| Background page download (`savePages`): covers first, then pages, 6 workers, progress | ✅ ➕ | App-level service (`CatalogStore`), not tied to a screen. Runs on any screen, like the original. Downloads every picture the app shows (granth cover + प्रकाशन, every praman page + its granth picture), visited or not: 985 files / ≈570 MB for the live catalog on 2026-10-21. Incremental and resumable (saved files are skipped). 3 tries per picture plus a second pass. Stops below 150 MB free with a message. A granth is marked offline only when all of its pictures are saved. |
| Visible download progress / live page count | ➕ (new) | One live number for the strip, the floating pill ("सिंक हो रहा है… 245 / 985 पेज") and the sync card ("985 में से 245 पेज सेव"). At start-up it is read from one listing of the images folder (no picture is opened, `.part` files never count); after that every page counts the moment it lands — background download, a page opened on screen — and a damaged file removed by the silent check is taken off. No button press needed, and it never restarts from 0. While the सिंक button's check runs, the number stays the real count and the bar shows the check's progress. The pill does not block taps and hides when done. |
| "सारे ग्रंथ ऑफलाइन हो गए हैं" card | ➕ (new) | Same card as PDF-done. Shown once per completed library and again only after new content finishes downloading. The library signature is saved when the card is shown. |
| Online-only by design | ℹ️ | YouTube videos and the external "मूल ग्रंथ" links (`granthURL`: 63 archive.org, 3 share.google, 2 pCloud) open in the browser, as in the original. Fonts are bundled. |
| Storage: IndexedDB `granth-offline` (meta/images/gallery/folders) + localStorage keys | ✅ | App documents dir (`app_flutter/granth`), not the cache dir: `catalog.json`, `images/`, `gallery/`, `gallery.json`, `folders.json`. SharedPreferences use the same key names (`ui-cols`, `topic-cols`, `granth-cols`, `praman-cols`, `gallery-cols`, `granth-look`, `pdf-style`, `granth-hash`, `granth-nav`, `granth-offline-ids`). |
| Damaged / restored data | ➕ | Bad JSON → ignored, fresh sync. Gallery rows whose file is gone are dropped. Offline ids are reset when no pictures exist (restored backup). |
| Keep data on uninstall / reinstall | ➕ (new) | `hasFragileUserData=true` (Android 10+ "keep app data"). Auto Backup is on for settings + catalog only (no pictures/PDFs). The original had `allowBackup=false`. |
| Atomic writes | ➕ | Every JSON/PDF/gallery file is written as `.part` then renamed. Leftovers are cleaned at start. |

## Screens

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mast: gradient, gold strip, logo, title, gallery + settings buttons | ✅ | Same CSS values. |
| Header stats (विषय / पवित्र ग्रन्थ / नए प्रमाण) with active glow | ✅ | Exact CSS: `0 0 0 2px gold, 0 0 18px gold-light 80%`, painted outside the tile only (like CSS). Fades in instead of snapping. |
| Hamburger menu (Dashboard / Topics / Granths / प्रमाण / Gallery) | ✅ | |
| Dashboard cards + note card | ➕ | Counts now update live after the first sync (they stayed 0 before). Numbers (cards and header stats) count up 0 → final once, when real data arrives. Later changes animate from the shown value. No replay on rebuild or settings change; it replays only on a fresh Dashboard open. |
| Topics: position sort, search, 1×1/2×2, card pills (प्रमाण, n/total, Share, PDF) | ✅ | |
| Multiple topic PDF (ordered pick, one combined PDF) | ✅ | |
| Granths header: "Multiple granth PDF" sits ~8 px lower so "Granths" stays on one line (checked at 360 dp, font scale 1.0 and 1.3) | ➕ | |
| Granths: position sort, search, 1×1/2×2/3×3, book-open animation, offline badge, granth URL, share, PDF | ✅ | |
| Multiple granth PDF | ➕ (new, requested) | Tick several granths; one PDF each, built in parallel. |
| Pramans: filters by topic / granth / id, chip with सभी प्रमाण, order rules (`order.ts`), card actions (zoom, save picture, share, PDF, YouTube) | ✅ | |
| Picture zoom (`PinchView`: pinch 1–4×, pan when zoomed, kept inside the frame, snaps to 1 near 1) | ✅ ➕ | `ZoomStage` in the praman viewer and the Gallery viewer. Pinch at the fingers 1–4×, pan when zoomed, edges kept in bounds, snaps back, flick glide. Double-tap zooms 2.5× at the tap point or back to 1× (gallery-style, requested; the original has none). The viewer claims the gesture, so the list behind it can no longer steal the pinch (that was the bug). |
| YouTube block | ✅ | |
| Gallery: PDF / picture tabs, folders, search, open / share / save / delete, 1×1/2×2 | ✅ | |
| सेटिंग: PDF सेटिंग, लेआउट 1×1/2×2 (all screens), hidden कार्ड स्टाइल (5 taps on Version), पीछे | ➕ | Every option now applies live and persists (before, the screens did not rebuild). |
| Card looks (combo, सादा, glass, neu, clay, material, flat, bento) | ✅ | |
| Search: Hindi + Roman (Hinglish) transliteration, fuzzy, synonyms | ➕ | Same matching; ~170× faster. 200 ms debounce; index built once per catalog, in the background. |
| Search analytics (search / search_empty after 800 ms) | ✅ | Same rule. Kept in a local event log (the original wrote it to its own admin DB layer). |
| Toasts, empty states, spinners, Hindi copy | ✅ | |
| Feel: scrolling and transitions | ➕ | iOS-like: every list bounces at its ends (`BouncingScrollPhysics` via one app-wide scroll behaviour, no Android glow); pushed full pages use the Cupertino slide; fades use `easeOutCubic`; the whole-app zoom layer and the picture zoom paint their content in a `RepaintBoundary` so a pinch only moves pixels. Layout and look unchanged. Screens are in-page panels (like the original web app), not routes, so there is no edge swipe-back between them; hardware / gesture back works as before. |
| Fonts: Noto Sans Devanagari, Yatra One, Tiro Devanagari Sanskrit, DM Sans | ✅ | Bundled. |

## PDF

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Styles "PDF विषय के साथ" (fill90) and "केवल चित्र" (original), remembered (`pdf-style`) | ✅ | |
| Content order: topic cover → for each granth (first time it appears): cover page + प्रकाशन page → its pramans (`order.ts`) | ✅ | |
| fill90 page: header text (maroon 17/16 pt), picture with 1 pt black border, footer (title · meta, brown 15/14 pt), font shrinks to 13 pt, long text flows on extra pages, landscape for wide pictures | ✅ | |
| original: picture only, white page, 10 pt margin, landscape when wide; text page only when the picture is missing | ✅ | |
| Decorated topic cover (radial blobs, vignette, triple frame, Yatra One title, body, "ग्रंथ प्रबंधन") | ✅ | |
| Page number stamp (Helvetica 11, maroon, cream tab) | ✅ | |
| Picture prep: JPEG kept as-is when it fits, else flatten on white + scale to 1800 px + JPEG | ➕ | Done natively (Android codec, worker threads, reduced-size decode of huge photos). JPEGs up to 2600 px / 1.5 MB are embedded untouched (faster). |
| Progress tray: phases, %, ETA, रोकें, open / share / save, auto-save to Downloads | ➕ | No queue: up to 3 at once (1–2 on low-RAM phones), each with its own row and retry. |
| `PdfDock` arrow (`⌄ N`, rotates when open) toggling the task list | ✅ ➕ | Same arrow in the header. The list is a compact dropdown under the arrow. It is **collapsed by default** and does not auto-open (deliberate, requested; the original auto-opens its deck). Each row has × to remove it for good (a running PDF asks first, then stops). "तैयार हटाएँ" clears finished rows. Asking for the same PDF twice on purpose makes two entries; only a double tap within 1.5 s is ignored. |
| Background PDF + notification | ➕ (new) | Android foreground service (`PdfService`, type `dataSync`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` + `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC`). Channels are created at app start (`pdf_progress_v2` IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT but silent, `pdf_done_v2` IMPORTANCE_HIGH; the first release's LOW channels are deleted because Android never raises an existing channel and some phones fold LOW notifications away). Monochrome white vector small icon. One ongoing notification ("2 PDF बन रही हैं — 45%"), plus a completion notification that opens the PDF (or the app). `startForeground` is the first thing `onStartCommand` does; a stop that arrives before the service has started is remembered and applied right after `startForeground` (no "did not start in time" crash on very short PDFs). The service stops when no PDF is running; Android 15 `onTimeout` stops it cleanly. Explicit R8 keep rules for the service. Logs under the `GranthPdf` tag (logcat). The Flutter engine is cached and kept while the service runs, so swiping the app away does not end a running PDF. Device-only behaviour (OEM killers, background rendering) is not verified in CI. |
| File names from title (70 chars), gallery ids `pdf-granth-/pdf-topic-/pdf-topics-/pdf-praman-`, marks granths offline | ✅ | |
| Save to Downloads (MediaStore on 10+, public folder + scan on ≤ 9) | ➕ | A failed copy deletes the pending MediaStore row or partial file. |

## Not ported (not part of the shipped app)

| Item | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `src/components/admin/*` (desk, inbox, manage), `admin-db`, roles, merge | Web-only admin/editor. Not in the APK bundle. |
| `feedback.tsx` (feedback / request form) | Present in the sources but not referenced by `app.tsx` and not in the shipped bundle. |
| `mobile/src/*` (old React Native screens, SQLite `db.ts`, ResourcePackService) | Dead code: `mobile/App.tsx` only hosts the WebView. |
| Web PWA (`sw.js`, `__grok` install page, auth/multiplayer libs, preview scripts) | Web hosting only. |

## Bugs found in the original app (not copied)

1. **PDF memory grows with the book.** `buildBookPdf` keeps every prepared picture in `shots[]` and the whole PDF in memory. It is then base64-chunked through the WebView bridge, which takes 3–4× the PDF size. Big granths can run out of memory.
   - Here: at most 3–8 pictures are held at a time, and pages stream to disk from a background isolate.
2. **Huge photos.** `fitShot` returns the original image when the canvas decode fails. A 60-megapixel page is then embedded as-is, or crashes the WebView.
   - Here: native reduced-size decode. Without native support, a placeholder page is used instead of decoding it.
3. **A failed picture is silent.** It becomes a page without the picture and nothing says why.
   - Here: the page shows "चित्र उपलब्ध नहीं…" and the row reports how many pictures were missing.
4. **Error text.** A failed PDF shows `error.message`, often English or technical.
   - Here: a clear Hindi message with "फिर कोशिश करें". Low storage gets its own message.
5. **Only one PDF at a time.** A long granth blocks every other request in the कतार.
   - Here: parallel slots.
6. **Tray cap of 12 rows.** `tasks.slice(0, 12)` could drop a still-running job from the list.
   - Here: only finished rows are trimmed.
7. **Finished PDFs stay in memory.** Their `Blob`s stay in RAM in the task list.
   - Here: files on disk only.
8. **Same link opened twice.** `sentLink` de-duplicates by exact URL forever, so opening the same shared link a second time does nothing.
   - Here: a 5 s de-dup window.
9. **Shared links could reach a blank screen.** A link delivered before the WebView was ready, and resume after the WebView renderer died, both needed a reload hack.
   - Here: native routing. The link is applied before the first frame.
10. **Dead layout controls.**
    - The Flutter port's own regression: 1×1 crashed into an empty screen, and the settings did not refresh open screens.
    - The original's grid worked; the port now matches it.
11. **Partial files.** No cleanup after a crash mid-save; MediaStore rows could stay pending.
    - Here: `.part` files, cleanup at start, and delete-on-failure.
12. **No free-space check.** A full disk fails late with a generic error.
    - Here: space is checked first, and ENOSPC is mapped to a clear message.
14. **Failed downloads counted as saved.** The original `savePages` counted a failed picture as done and always ended with done = total, with no retry. The strip then said "सभी पेज इस डिवाइस पर सेव हैं" even when pictures were missing.
    - Here: 3 tries plus a second pass. Failures are counted and tried again on the next sync. A granth is marked offline only when all of its pictures are saved.
15. **No storage guard for page downloads.** The original kept downloading until the disk was full.
    - Here: the download stops below 150 MB free.
16. **Frozen sync strip.** In the port the strip was a `const` child inside the store listener, so its spinner and text never changed after a tap ("tap does nothing"). When all pages were saved, the page step ended at once, so no progress showed. Fixed: the strip rebuilds from the store, and manual sync always checks pages visibly.
17. **Counters restarting from 0.** The splash returned its child in a different tree position when it finished, which rebuilt the whole shell. Fixed with a stable key; counters remember what they already showed.
18. **Page counter showed 0 while pages were downloading.** The number came from the running download pass's own tally, which the silent start-up check restarted from 0 (it counted files as it re-checked them) and every sync replaced. Fixed: one live count of the files really on the phone (see "Visible download progress").
19. **PDF notification not visible on some phones.** Progress channel was IMPORTANCE_LOW (hidden in "silent" folds), notifications that the phone switched off were never detected (no dialog on Android ≤ 12), and the permission answer was never checked. Fixed as described under "Background PDF + notification".
13. **Dashboard counts.** They stayed at 0 until you navigated away and back after the first sync (port regression, fixed).
